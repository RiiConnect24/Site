			<p><b>Q: What is RiiConnect24?</b></p>
			<p>RiiConnect24 is a replacement to a defunct service for the Wii called WiiConnect24. It allowed users to
				exchange mail between Wiis and use fun channels such as the Forecast and News Channel. WiiConnect24 was
				shut down on June 28, 2013, however RiiConnect24 brings back those services.</p>
			<p><b>Q: Why are you bringing WiiConnect24 back?</b></p>
			<p>A lot of people missed the channels that were offered with WiiConnect24, because they were fun,
				innovative, unique, and had nice music. It's nice to see the online features of the Wii being brought
				back, especially after such a long down-time.</p>
			<p><b>Q: Does RiiConnect24 allow me to play Wii games online again?</b></p>
			<p>No, you are confusing this service with Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, another service that was shut down. If
				you want to play Wii games online again, take a look at <a href="https://wiimmfi.de/">Wiimmfi</a>, we
				are affiliated with them.</p>
			<p><b>Q: How do I connect to RiiConnect24?</b></p>
			<p>Please see our guide at <a href="https://wii.guide/">wii.guide</a>.</p>
			<p><b>Q: Do I need to mod my Wii to use this service?</b></p>
			<p>Yes. However, the process of modding your Wii is pretty easy and allows you to do many other cool things
				with your system.</p>
			<p><b>Q: Am I able to use RiiConnect24 and Wiimmfi at the same time?</b></p>
			<p>Yes. Using both will give you maximum compatibility. An example of a game which uses both would be Animal
				Crossing Wii. You can receive DLC over RiiConnect24, and play with people online using Wiimmfi.</p>
			<p><b>Q: What services have been brought back?</b></p>
			<p>Check our <a href="/stats/index.html">stats page</a> for information on our services that we have brought
				back.</p>
			<p><b>Q: Does RiiConnect24 work on Dolphin Emulator?</b></p>
			<p>Yes. However, Wii Mail does not work. Follow <a href="https://wii.guide/riiconnect24-dolphin">this
					guide</a> to install RiiConnect24 on Dolphin.</p>
			<p><b>Q: What's the meaning behind the name of the service?</b></p>
			<p>Our name is a pun on the WiiConnect24 name, as we are "re-connecting" you to WiiConnect24.</p>
			<p><b>Q: How can I help out with RiiConnect24?</b></p>
