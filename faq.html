			<p><b>Q: What is RiiConnect24?</b></p>
			<p>RiiConnect24 is a replacement to a defunct service for the Wii called WiiConnect24. It allowed users to exchange mail between Wiis and use fun channels such as the Forecast and News Channel. The service was shut down on June 28, 2013.</p>
			<p><b>Q: Why are you bringing WiiConnect24 back?</b></p>
			<p>A lot of people missed the channels that were offered with WiiConnect24, because they were fun, innovative, unique, and had nice music. It's nice to see the online features of the Wii being brought back, especially after such a long down-time.</p>
			<p><b>Q: Does RiiConnect24 allow me to play Wii games online again?</b></p>
			<p>No, you are confusing this service with Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, another service that was shut down. If you want to play Wii games online again, take a look at <a href="https://wiimmfi.de/">Wiimmfi</a>, we work closely with them.</p>
			<p><b>Q: How do I connect to RiiConnect24?</b></p>
			<p>Please see our guide at <a href="https://wii.guide/">wii.guide</a>.</p>
			<p><b>Q: Do I need to mod my Wii to use this service?</b></p>
			<p>Yes. However, the process of modding your Wii is pretty easy and allows you to do many other cool things with your Wii.</p>
			<p><b>Q: Am I able to use RiiConnect24 and Wiimmfi at the same time?</b></p>
			<p>Yes. Using both will give you full compatibility. An example of a game which uses both would be Animal Crossing. You can receive DLC over RiiConnect24, and play with people online using Wiimmfi.</p>
			<p><b>Q: What services have been brought back?</b></p>
			<p>Check our <a href="/stats/index.html">stats page</a> for information on our services that we have brought back.</p>
			<p><b>Q: Will you bring back the Check Mii Out/Mii Contest Channel?</b></p>
			<p>It currently isn't supported with RiiConnect24. However, we plan to support it in the future, a lot of people really want to see that Channel back. Some work has been done on it!</p>
			<p><b>Q: Does RiiConnect24 work on Dolphin Emulator?</b></p>
			<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't work properly at the moment because Dolphin doesn't have code to emulate WiiConnect24.</p>
			<p><b>Q: What's the meaning behind the name of the service?</b></p>
			<p>Our name is a pun on the original WiiConnect24 name, as we are "re-connecting" you to WiiConnect24.</p>
			<p><b>Q: How can I help out with RiiConnect24?</b></p>
			<p>Our code is open source on <a href="https://github.com/RiiConnect24">GitHub</a>, so if you understand that sort of thing we would love for you to help out.</p>
			<p><b>Q: Do you guys have a Discord server?</b></p>
			<p>Yes. Check our homepage.</p>
			<p><b>Q: I need help! How can I get support?</b></p>
			<p>Either join our Discord server or e-mail <a href="mailto:support@riiconnect24.net">support@riiconnect24.net</a>.</p>
