    <p class="light">The TV no Tomo Channel G Guide for Wii was a Japan-exclusive Channel that let you browse a TV
      guide. You could also use your Wii Remote as a TV remote using it, a feature that apparently would have been used
      on the Wii Menu but was scrapped. You could rate programs and send out alerts 30 minutes before a program is
      starting via an email or text. Also, you used a stamp to mark programs that interest you. This Channel used
      G-Guide from <a href="https://www.ipg.co.jp">IPG</a>. Also, <a href="http://www.hallab.co.jp/eng/">HAL
        Laboratory</a>, best known by making games in the Super Smash Bros. and Kirby franchise, helped make this
      Channel.</p>
