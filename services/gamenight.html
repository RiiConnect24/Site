				Every week in the RiiConnect24 Discord server, we pick a Wii and DS game to play on <a href="https://wiimmfi.de/">Wiimmfi</a> with other Discord users. DS games are played on Friday, and Wii games are played on Saturday. We smash the record of the maximum users online at once for games all the time!
				<br>
				Instead of playing games like Mario Kart Wii (the most popular game on Wiimmfi by far), we like to play more obscure gems that are fun to play but don't get a lot of attention.
				<br>
				To participate in Game Nights, join the Discord server and then go to #random and type in `/roleme Game Night`.
