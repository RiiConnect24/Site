            <p>On June 1, 2023, RiiConnect24 will be deprecating the old server used to provide DNS services
                (164.132.44.106) and you can no longer
                connect to RiiConnect24 using that DNS. Additionally, that DNS is used by some people to enjoy games
                online using Wiimmfi using Wii or DS. You will have to change the DNS on that as well. In order to
                continue using RiiConnect24, you must change your DNS to the following on your Wii and/or DS...</p>
            <br>
            <h5>Primary DNS: 167.86.108.126</h5>
            <h5>Secondary DNS: 1.1.1.1</h5>
            <br>
            <p>Thank you for the continued support of RiiConnect24.</p>

            <p>P.S. Be sure to <a href="https://discord.gg/rc24">join our Discord</a> to receive important updates
                regarding RiiConnect24, as we are no longer using Twitter as a form of communication because of the
                state of the platform because of Elon
                Musk and other reasons.</p>
            <p>P.P.S. Our website needs a revamp, we're gonna try to have it revamped to give it a nice fresh coat of
                paint.</p>
